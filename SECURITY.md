# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Overview

The n8n Setup Scripts project takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting process, and security considerations for users.

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

We currently provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability in our scripts, please help us by reporting it responsibly:

**Do:**
- Email security reports to: `security@yourproject.com` (replace with actual email)
- Include detailed information about the vulnerability
- Provide steps to reproduce the issue
- Allow time for us to investigate and respond

**Don't:**
- Open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
- Share vulnerability details publicly before we've had time to address them
- Test vulnerabilities against systems you don't own

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
3. **Reproduction Steps**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Environment**: OS version, script version, and other relevant details
5. **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, include a proof-of-concept
6. **Remediation**: If you have suggestions for fixing the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Status Updates**: Weekly updates on progress
- **Resolution**: Depends on severity and complexity

## 🔍 Security Considerations for Users

### Before Running Scripts

1. **Review the Code**: Always review scripts before running them
2. **Verify Source**: Ensure scripts come from the official repository
3. **Check Integrity**: Verify file checksums if provided
4. **Use HTTPS**: Always download scripts using HTTPS
5. **Backup Data**: Backup important data before running installation scripts

### Network Security

- Scripts download components from the internet
- All downloads use HTTPS for encryption
- Package managers verify checksums automatically
- Consider using a firewall to monitor outbound connections

### Execution Permissions

- Scripts require elevated permissions for system-level changes
- Review permission requests before granting access
- Use principle of least privilege
- Consider running scripts in isolated environments for testing

## 🏢 Enterprise Security

### Corporate Environments

For enterprise or corporate environments, consider:

1. **Proxy Configuration**: Configure scripts for corporate proxies
2. **Firewall Rules**: Ensure necessary domains are whitelisted
3. **Security Scanning**: Scan scripts with your security tools
4. **Air-Gapped Networks**: Consider offline installation methods
5. **Change Management**: Follow your organization's change management process

### Security Scanning

We recommend scanning our scripts with:
- Static analysis tools (ShellCheck for Bash, PSScriptAnalyzer for PowerShell)
- Virus/malware scanners
- Corporate security tools
- SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools

## 🔐 Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

1. **Input Validation**: Scripts validate user inputs and system requirements
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling prevents unexpected behavior
3. **Logging**: Detailed logging for audit trails
4. **Checksum Verification**: Package managers verify component integrity
5. **HTTPS Downloads**: All network communications use encryption

### Authentication and Authorization

- Scripts use system package managers for authentication
- No hardcoded credentials or API keys
- Leverages OS-level security mechanisms
- Follows platform security best practices

## 🚫 Known Security Limitations

### Inherent Risks

1. **Internet Dependencies**: Scripts require internet access for downloads
2. **Elevated Privileges**: Installation requires administrator/sudo access
3. **Third-party Components**: Dependencies on external package managers
4. **Dynamic Content**: Scripts download the latest versions of components

### Mitigation Strategies

- Use isolated test environments
- Monitor network traffic during installation
- Regular security updates and patches
- Follow security best practices for your environment
